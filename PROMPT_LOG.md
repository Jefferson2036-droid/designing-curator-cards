# Prompt Log- The exploration phase #

## Prompt 1 ## 

- **Phase:** Exploration
- **Prompt Name:** Concept Map
- **What I sent** 

Create a concept map showing how these three design movements relate to each other:
1. Bauhaus (1919–1933)
2. International Typographic Style / Swiss Style (1950s–1970s)
3. New Wave Typography (1970s–1980s)

Show: key figures, core principles, what each movement inherited from or rejected about the previous one. Use plain text with indentation — no images.

-**What I got back(summary)** 

The response that I received back was a timeline in the order each typology was made. It describes each typographic style and gives: key figures, core principles and influence on later movement. Additionally, It highlights the traits inherited from past generations, showing how each era's principles molded artistic expression. 

-**What I did with it:**

Pasted the concept map to CURATOR_NOTES.MD.

## Prompt 2 ##

- **Phase:** Exploration
- **Prompt Name:** Controlled Vocabulary
- **What I sent** 

Generate a controlled vocabulary list of 20 domain-specific terms used in design history when discussing Bauhaus, Swiss Style, and New Wave Typography.

For each term provide:
- The term
- A one-sentence definition (max 15 words)
- Which movement(s) it applies to

Only include terms a design professional would use. No vague words like "creative" or "innovative."

- # What I got back

A list of 20 terms that were very dscriptive for the curator cards. The only term I considered discarding was 'Universal Design'. In a more modern context universal design means something else that might be a point of confusion. 

- # What I did with it

Took the 19 terms and added it to AGENTS.MD

## Prompt 3 ##

- **Phase:** Exploration
- **Prompt Name:** Draft Labels
- **What I sent** 

Read my AGENTS.md (pasted below) and write 3 Curator Cards.

Each card must follow this exact schema:
- Title: Movement name and date range
- Body: 80–120 words, museum-label tone
- Tags: exactly 5 domain-specific vocabulary terms
- Examples: 2 real links to museum collections
- Confusion: "Not to be confused with ___ because ___."
- Accountability: "I verified this by checking [source]."

Use ONLY the vocabulary from my controlled vocabulary list.
If you are unsure about any fact, write VERIFY instead of guessing.

- # What I got back

- **Title:** Bauhaus (1919–1933)  
- **Body:**  
The Bauhaus was a pioneering design school founded by Walter Gropius in Weimar, Germany, in 1919. It emphasized the integration of art, craft, and technology, promoting functionalism and rejecting excessive ornamentation. Bauhaus designers utilized geometric forms and modularity to create objects and architecture that were both practical and accessible for mass production. The movement’s focus on universal design and minimalism influenced modernist design globally, shaping disciplines from graphic design to architecture. Despite its closure in 1933 due to political pressure, Bauhaus remains a cornerstone of modern design education and practice.  
- **Tags:** Functionalism, Geometric Forms, Modularity, Minimalism, Universal Design  
- **Examples:**  
  1. [Bauhaus Collection at MoMA](https://www.moma.org/collection/works?classifications=any&department_id=3)  
  2. [Bauhaus Archive Museum](https://www.bauhaus.de/en/)  
- **Confusion:** Not to be confused with Swiss Style, which focused on grid systems and typographic clarity.  
- **Accountability:** I verified this by checking [MoMA](https://www.moma.org) and [Bauhaus Archive](https://www.bauhaus.de/en/).  

## Prompt 4 ##

- **Phase:** Critique
- **Prompt Name:** Expert Critique
- **What I sent** 

Review my Curator Card about New Wave Typography as if you were Wolfgang Weingart.

Using only Weingart's documented writings, teachings, and known positions:
1. What would he praise about this description?
2. What would he challenge or correct?
3. Is the vocabulary appropriate to how he discussed design?
4. What's missing that he would consider essential?

If you are unsure about a fact or attribution, write VERIFY instead of guessing.
