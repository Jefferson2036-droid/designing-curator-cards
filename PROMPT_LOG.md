# Prompt Log- The exploration phase #

## Prompt 1 ## 

- **Phase:** Exploration
- **Prompt Name:** Concept Map
- **What I sent** 

Create a concept map showing how these three design movements relate to each other:
1. Bauhaus (1919–1933)
2. International Typographic Style / Swiss Style (1950s–1970s)
3. New Wave Typography (1970s–1980s)

Show: key figures, core principles, what each movement inherited from or rejected about the previous one. Use plain text with indentation — no images.

-**What I got back(summary)** 

The response that I received back was a timeline in the order each typology was made. It describes each typographic style and gives: key figures, core principles and influence on later movement. Additionally, It highlights the traits inherited from past generations, showing how each era's principles molded artistic expression. 

-**What I did with it:**

Pasted the concept map to CURATOR_NOTES.MD.

## Prompt 2 ##

- **Phase:** Exploration
- **Prompt Name:** Controlled Vocabulary
- **What I sent** 

Generate a controlled vocabulary list of 20 domain-specific terms used in design history when discussing Bauhaus, Swiss Style, and New Wave Typography.

For each term provide:
- The term
- A one-sentence definition (max 15 words)
- Which movement(s) it applies to

Only include terms a design professional would use. No vague words like "creative" or "innovative."

- # What I got back

A list of 20 terms that were very dscriptive for the curator cards. The only term I considered discarding was 'Universal Design'. In a more modern context universal design means something else that might be a point of confusion. 

- # What I did with it

Took the 19 terms and added it to AGENTS.MD

## Prompt 3 ##

- **Phase:** Exploration
- **Prompt Name:** Draft Labels
- **What I sent** 

Read my AGENTS.md (pasted below) and write 3 Curator Cards.

Each card must follow this exact schema:
- Title: Movement name and date range
- Body: 80–120 words, museum-label tone
- Tags: exactly 5 domain-specific vocabulary terms
- Examples: 2 real links to museum collections
- Confusion: "Not to be confused with ___ because ___."
- Accountability: "I verified this by checking [source]."

Use ONLY the vocabulary from my controlled vocabulary list.
If you are unsure about any fact, write VERIFY instead of guessing.

- # What I did with it

I took all three curator cards and put them into a new file called #DRAFTS.MD. In this file I analyzed and saw that curator cards were alright. 

## Prompt 4 ##

- **Phase:** Critique
- **Prompt Name:** Expert Critique
- **What I sent** 

Review my Curator Card about swiss style in #file:DRAFTS.MD as if you were David Carson. Critique the accuracy, vocabulary, and tone. Flag anything that expert would challenge. If you are unsure about a fact, write VERIFY instead of guessing.

# What I got back 

s David Carson, I would approach the critique of this Curator Card with a focus on its adherence to the principles of Swiss Style and its relevance to the broader context of design. Here is my review:

Accuracy:

The card accurately describes the foundational elements of Swiss Style, such as the use of the grid system, sans-serif typography, and functionalism. These are indeed hallmarks of the movement.
However, the description could benefit from a more nuanced explanation of how Swiss Style influenced modern design. For example, the card mentions corporate branding and advertising but does not elaborate on how Swiss Style principles were applied in these contexts. This could be expanded for clarity.
The phrase "post-war Europe" is accurate but could be more specific, as Swiss Style primarily developed in Switzerland and Germany. This distinction is important to avoid overgeneralization.
Vocabulary:

The vocabulary aligns well with the controlled list, and terms like grid system, sans-serif typography, and functionalism are appropriate.
However, the term flat color might not be the most precise choice for describing Swiss Style. While color was used sparingly, the emphasis was more on clarity and contrast rather than flatness. A term like minimalism might be more fitting here.
Tone:

The tone is professional and museum-appropriate, but it feels somewhat detached. Swiss Style was not just about clarity but also about a philosophy of communication and universal understanding. The card could benefit from a more engaging explanation of why these principles were revolutionary for their time (without using banned words like "revolutionary").
Challenges:

The card states that Swiss Style "became a cornerstone of modern graphic design," which is true, but it does not address the critiques of Swiss Style, such as its perceived rigidity or lack of emotional expression. As someone who challenged the strictness of Swiss Style, I would argue that this perspective is missing.
The card could also mention how Swiss Style's focus on clarity and order influenced later movements, including New Wave Typography, which sought to break away from its constraints.
Suggestions:

Include a brief mention of the cultural and historical context in Switzerland and Germany that led to the development of Swiss Style.
Replace flat color with minimalism to better align with the movement's principles.
Acknowledge the critiques of Swiss Style, particularly its rigidity, and how it inspired later movements like New Wave Typography.
VERIFY:

The claim that Swiss Style "influenced corporate branding, advertising, and public communication systems worldwide" is likely accurate but should be supported with specific examples or sources.

# What I got

- **Title:** Bauhaus (1919–1933)  
- **Body:**  
The Bauhaus was a design school founded by Walter Gropius in Weimar, Germany, in 1919. It sought to unify art, craft, and technology, emphasizing *functionalism* and rejecting excessive ornamentation in favor of practicality. Bauhaus designers embraced *geometric forms* and *modularity* to create objects and architecture that were both functional and suitable for *mass production*. The movement’s focus on *universal design* and *minimalism* shaped modernist design globally, influencing fields such as graphic design, industrial design, and architecture. Although the school was closed in 1933 due to political pressure, its principles and teachings remain a cornerstone of modern design education and practice, inspiring generations of designers worldwide.  
- **Tags:** functionalism, geometric forms, modularity, minimalism, universal design  
- **Examples:**  
  1. [Bauhaus Collection at MoMA](https://www.moma.org/collection/works?classifications=any&department_id=3)  
  2. [Bauhaus Archive Museum](https://www.bauhaus.de/en/)  
- **Confusion:** Not to be confused with Swiss Style, which focused on grid systems and typographic clarity.  
- **Accountability:** I verified this by checking [MoMA](https://www.moma.org) and [Bauhaus Archive](https://www.bauhaus.de/en/).  

### New Wave Typography (1970s–1980s)

- **Title**: New Wave Typography (1970s–1980s)  
- **Body**:  
New Wave Typography emerged as a reaction against the rigid conventions of Swiss Style, introducing a more experimental and expressive approach to design. It rejected strict *grid systems* in favor of *dynamic layouts* and *deconstruction*, resulting in fragmented and unconventional compositions. Designers embraced *expressive typography* and *negative space* to challenge traditional ideas of legibility and communication. Often incorporating *photomontage*, New Wave Typography reflected a shift toward individualism and a break from modernist ideals. This movement left a lasting impact on postmodern graphic design, influencing contemporary practices and encouraging designers to explore new creative possibilities while questioning established norms.  
- **Tags**: grid system, dynamic layouts, deconstruction, expressive typography, negative space  
- **Examples**:  
  1. [Wolfgang Weingart works at MoMA](https://www.moma.org/collection/works/artist/6296)  
  2. [New Wave Typography at Cooper Hewitt](https://collection.cooperhewitt.org/)  
- **Confusion**: Not to be confused with Grunge because New Wave Typography retains structure and precision, while Grunge embraces chaos and distressed aesthetics.  
- **Accountability**: I verified this by checking [source].  

### Curator Card: Swiss Style (1950s–1970s)

- **Title**: Swiss Style (1950s–1970s)  
- **Body**:  
Swiss Style, also known as the International Typographic Style, emerged in Switzerland and Germany after World War II to address the need for clear and effective communication. It is defined by the *grid system*, which allowed for structured and balanced layouts, and *sans-serif typography*, which ensured clarity and readability. The movement emphasized *functionalism* and *universal design*, prioritizing *minimalism* by eliminating unnecessary elements to focus on essential content. Swiss Style became a cornerstone of modern graphic design, influencing corporate branding, advertising, and public communication systems worldwide. Its perceived rigidity and strict conventions later inspired movements like New Wave Typography, which sought to challenge its principles and explore more expressive approaches to design.  
- **Tags**: grid system, sans-serif typography, functionalism, universal design, minimalism  
- **Examples**:  
  1. [Josef Müller-Brockmann posters at MoMA](https://www.moma.org/collection/works/artist/3972)  
  2. [Swiss Style collection at Cooper Hewitt](https://collection.cooperhewitt.org/)  
- **Confusion**: Not to be confused with Bauhaus because Swiss Style focuses on typographic clarity and grid systems, while Bauhaus integrates art, craft, and industrial production with a broader focus on design.  
- **Accountability**: I verified this by checking [source].  ### Curator Card: Swiss Style (1950s–1970s)
