## What I Think I know 

At first I didnt know anything about swiss styles. After an initial search I learned a couple of facts. 

It is a graphic design movement that emerged in Switzerland during the 1950's. 

Swiss Style focuses on being minimalistic, ensuring that the message is clearly visible 

Swiss style was a descendent of Bauhaus style.

Swiss style became a product of designers playing around with bauhaus style. 

New wave topography is the exact opposite of swiss style, disorganized and pictures overlapping

## What Im unsure about

I am unsure which specific typefaces (like Helvetica or Univers) are mandatory for it to be called 'Swiss Style'.

I am unsure if 'Grunge' and 'New Wave' are the same thing or if Grunge came much later (1990s).

## Vocabulary I need

Breaking the Grid: Unlike the Swiss Style which follows the "checkerboard" strictly, New Wave designers intentionally placed things at weird angles or off-center to create energy.

Letterspacing: Designers would put huge gaps between letters or squish them together to make the words look like a piece of art rather than just something to read.

Layering: Instead of a flat, clean page, they would stack photos, colors, and text on top of each other, creating a "busy" look with lots of depth.

Inverted Type: This is when you have white text on a black background or colored blocks. Swiss style usually kept it simple (black text on white), but New Wave loved high-contrast colors.

Intuition: While Swiss Style is "mathematical," New Wave is "emotional." The designer places things where they feel right, even if it’s not perfectly aligned.

The Grid: A mathematical framework used to organize content objectively.

Sans-serif: Typefaces without the "feet" at the ends of letters, chosen for clarity.

Objective Photography: Using real photos to communicate facts rather than drawings or illustrations.

## Pinned: Confusions and Boundaries (from AI)

Mandatory Typefaces: While no single font is strictly required, using a neutral, sans-serif typeface like Helvetica, Univers, or Akzidenz-Grotesk is essential for a design to be classified as true Swiss Style.

New Wave vs. Grunge: These are distinct movements; New Wave was a 1970s experimental rebellion that played with Swiss rules, while Grunge was a much later 1990s movement that focused on raw, distressed, and "dirty" textures.
