# Draft 1 

- **Title:** Bauhaus (1919–1933)  
- **Body:**  
The Bauhaus was a pioneering design school founded by Walter Gropius in Weimar, Germany, in 1919. It emphasized the integration of art, craft, and technology, promoting functionalism and rejecting excessive ornamentation. Bauhaus designers utilized geometric forms and modularity to create objects and architecture that were both practical and accessible for mass production. The movement’s focus on universal design and minimalism influenced modernist design globally, shaping disciplines from graphic design to architecture. Despite its closure in 1933 due to political pressure, Bauhaus remains a cornerstone of modern design education and practice.

- **Confusion:** Not to be confused with Swiss Style, which focused on grid systems and typographic clarity.

### New Wave Typography (1970s–1980s)

- **Title**: New Wave Typography (1970s–1980s)  
- **Body**: New Wave Typography emerged as a reaction to the structured precision of Swiss Style, embracing a more experimental and expressive approach to design. This movement rejected strict *grid systems* in favor of *dynamic layouts* and *deconstruction*, creating fragmented and unconventional compositions. Designers utilized *expressive typography* and *negative space* to challenge traditional notions of legibility and communication. Often incorporating *photomontage*, New Wave Typography reflected a shift towards individualism and a break from modernist ideals, leaving a lasting impact on postmodern graphic design.

  2. [New Wave Typography at Cooper Hewitt](https://collection.cooperhewitt.org/)  
- **Confusion**: Not to be confused with Grunge because New Wave Typography retains a sense of structure and precision, whereas Grunge embraces chaos and distressed aesthetics.

### Curator Card: Swiss Style (1950s–1970s)

- **Title**: Swiss Style (1950s–1970s)  
- **Body**: Swiss Style, also known as the International Typographic Style, emerged in post-war Europe as a response to the need for clear and effective communication. This movement is defined by its use of the *grid system* to create structured and balanced layouts, *sans-serif typography* for clarity, and *flat color* for simplicity. Designers emphasized *functionalism* and *universal design*, aiming to create work that was accessible and understandable across cultures and languages. Swiss Style became a cornerstone of modern graphic design, influencing corporate branding, advertising, and public communication systems worldwide.  
- **Tags**: grid system, sans-serif typography, flat color, functionalism, universal design

  2. [Swiss Style collection at Cooper Hewitt](https://collection.cooperhewitt.org/)  
- **Confusion**: Not to be confused with Bauhaus because Swiss Style focuses on typographic clarity and grid systems, while Bauhaus integrates art, craft, and industrial production with a broader focus on design.

# Revised Swiss Style with expert critique

- **Title**: Swiss Style (1950s–1970s)  
- **Body**: Swiss Style, also known as the International Typographic Style, emerged in Switzerland and Germany in the post-war period, driven by a need for clear and effective communication. This movement is defined by its use of the *grid system* to create structured and balanced layouts, *sans-serif typography* for clarity, and a commitment to *functionalism* and *universal design*. Designers prioritized *minimalism*, removing unnecessary elements to focus on essential content. While Swiss Style became a cornerstone of modern graphic design, influencing corporate branding and public communication systems, its perceived rigidity later inspired movements like New Wave Typography, which sought to challenge its strict conventions.
