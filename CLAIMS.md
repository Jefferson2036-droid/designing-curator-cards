# CLAIMS.md — Verification Log

## Card 1: Bauhaus

### Claim 1
- **Claim:** The Bauhaus was founded by Walter Gropius in Weimar, Germany in 1919.
- **Source link(s):** https://www.moma.org/collection/artists/2330
- **Confidence:** High
- **Notes:** MoMA's archive confirms the 1919 start date. It remained in Weimar until 1925 before moving to Dessau and finally Berlin.

### Claim 2
- **Claim:** The curriculum included the Vorkurs (foundation course) developed by faculty including Moholy-Nagy.
- **Source link(s):** https://www.moma.org/collection/works/189319
- **Confidence:** High
- **Notes:** I initially thought Moholy-Nagy created the course, but sources show Johannes Itten started it. Moholy-Nagy later revised it to be more industrial. My card reflects this "development" rather than "creation."

## Card 2: International Typographic Style (Swiss Style)

### Claim 1
- **Claim:** Josef Müller-Brockmann and Armin Hofmann championed the mathematical grid to organize content.
- **Source link(s):** https://www.moma.org/artists/4156
- **Confidence:** High
- **Notes:** Müller-Brockmann’s 1981 book "Grid Systems in Graphic Design" is the definitive proof of this methodology. MoMA’s collection confirms his application of these grids in posters.

### Claim 2
- **Claim:** Helvetica (1957) became a signature typeface for the movement's objective goals.
- **Source link(s):** https://www.moma.org/collection/works/7233
- **Confidence:** High
- **Notes:** Verification shows Helvetica was designed by Max Miedinger and Eduard Hoffmann at the Haas foundry to provide a neutral, legible voice.

## Card 3: New Wave Typography

### Claim 1
- **Claim:** Wolfgang Weingart broke the traditional Swiss grid at the Basel School of Design.
- **Source link(s):** https://www.moma.org/artists/2330
- **Confidence:** High
- **Notes:** Weingart was actually a student of the Swiss masters (Ruder and Hofmann) before he began "breaking" their rules, which confirms the "rebellion" aspect of the movement.

### Claim 2
- **Claim:** April Greiman extended these experiments into early digital tools like the Macintosh.
- **Source link(s):** https://collection.cooperhewitt.org/objects/18651817/
- **Confidence:** High
- **Notes:** Cooper Hewitt archives confirm Greiman’s status as a pioneer in digital layering and "hybrid imagery" during the 1980s.

## Reflection

**One AI claim I didn't trust at first and how I verified it:**

The AI suggested that New Wave and Grunge were essentially the same because they both "break the grid." I didn't trust this because the visual "vibe" felt different. I checked the "Confusions and Boundaries" section of my research notes and verified that New Wave (1970s/80s) is a technical, layered rebellion rooted in formal Swiss training, while Grunge (1990s) is a distressed, anti-commercial movement focused on raw textures. I corrected my card to ensure the "New Wave" description focused on layering and letterspacing rather than "dirty" or "distressed" elements.
